# act defaults for this repo.
#
# Why:
# - GitHub Actions uses Ubuntu runners with a bunch of preinstalled deps.
# - act runs jobs in Docker containers, so we pick a “full” image that closely
#   matches ubuntu-latest.
# - On Apple Silicon, force linux/amd64 to match CI (and avoid native-arm quirks).
