# act defaults for this repo.
#
# Why:
# - GitHub Actions uses Ubuntu runners with a bunch of preinstalled deps.
# - act runs jobs in Docker containers, so we pick a “full” image that closely
#   matches ubuntu-latest.
# - On Apple Silicon, force linux/amd64 to match CI (and avoid native-arm quirks).

# Prefer the official Playwright image for local act runs. This more closely matches
# the GUI/browser dependencies needed for VS Code + Playwright/Electron runs.
-P ubuntu-latest=mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-jammy
--container-architecture linux/amd64

# Cache downloaded actions between runs.
# NOTE: act does not expand '~' in this file, so use a repo-local path.
